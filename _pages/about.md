I am an Assistant Professor of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://engineering.ucsc.edu/departments/computer-science-and-engineering) at [University of California, Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu/). Before that, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/), working closely with [Prof. Lei Xing](https://med.stanford.edu/xinglab.html) and [Prof. Matthew Lungren](https://profiles.stanford.edu/matthew-lungren). I have received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), under the supervision of [Bloomberg Distinguished Professor Alan Yuille](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/). 

My lab's research focus on: **A. Multimodal & Agentic AI**, including 1) high-fidelity video generation and instruction-driven real-world image and video editing, 2) robust multimodal reasoning across vision, language, and temporal data, and 3) agentic AI systems that enhance VLM/LLM operability, to autonomously navigate complex environments and real-world constraints for reliable deployment. **B. 4D Longitudinal Patient Modeling & Digital Twins**, including 1) multimodal fusion integrating heterogeneous medical data across medical imaging (MRI, CT, pathology), genomic information, and EHRs, 2) temporal patient modeling to track health trajectories, and 3) enable proactive healthcare through patient digital twins that simulate disease progression and predict treatment response. Ultimately, we aim to build AI collaborators that empower clinicians with proactive diagnostics and personalized treatment strategies, improving patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency.

I am co-leading [the Vision · Learning · Assured Autonomy (VLAA) Lab](https://ucsc-vlaa.github.io/) with [Prof. Cihang Xie](https://cihangxie.github.io/). <span style="color: red;">We are always actively looking for self-motivated PhD/interns.</span> Welcome to apply from [here](https://ucsc-vlaa.github.io/opening.html) and drop me an [email](mailto:yzhou284@ucsc.edu) with your CV and publications (if any). The official PhD application portal is [here](https://grad.soe.ucsc.edu/admissions) 

<span style="color: red;">Due to the large amount of emails I receive, I may not be able to respond to each one individually. </span>
