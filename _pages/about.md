I am an Assistant Professor of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://engineering.ucsc.edu/departments/computer-science-and-engineering) at [University of California, Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu/). Before that, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/), working closely with [Prof. Lei Xing](https://med.stanford.edu/xinglab.html) and [Prof. Matthew Lungren](https://profiles.stanford.edu/matthew-lungren). I have received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), under the supervision of [Bloomberg Distinguished Professor Alan Yuille](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/).

Our group is particualy focusing on advancing biomedical artificial intelligence. Our ultimate goal is to match medical experts in decision-making. Specifically, we focus on: 1) creating innovative and cutting-edge medical multimodal model; 2) building real-world learning systems that ensure fair, trustworthy and real-time feedacks to clinicians, caregivers, and even patients; 3) one-shot/few-shot adaptation of open foundation models to diverse medical tasks; 4) synthetic data generation aligned with clinical knowledge. 


<span style="color: red;">I am looking for multiple self-motivated PhD/interns to work on machine learning, computer vision and AI for healthcare. Welcome to apply from [here](https://grad.soe.ucsc.edu/admissions) and drop me an [email](mailto:yzhou284@ucsc.edu) with your CV and publications (if any). </span>

<span style="color: red;">Due to the large amount of emails I receive, I may not be able to respond to each one individually. </span>
